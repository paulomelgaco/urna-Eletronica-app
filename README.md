==========================

The Project
---------
This app is intended to simulate the Brazilian Electronic Voting Machine, to either allow people to pretend they're voting again on their favorite candidates/parties, oe even create their own elections, using their picture as candidates, setup their numbers, party and role.


Some Functions (implemented or not)
-------------------------------
- Vote on actual candidates from past elections,
- Setup custom candidates with pictures from camera roll,
- Resize the picture to fit the specs, with B/W color too,
- Check results, with a list and a pizza chart,
- Sounds simulating the real Voting Machine.
